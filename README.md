# DTMF-Robot
This Repository contains all designs for the filters in Multisim
All filters for the DTMF robot, which were designed to pass the frequencies of the numbers 2, 4, 5, and 6 to move the robot are featured in detail. In the final design, five filters were used to control the movement of the robot. Number 2 moves the robot forward, No. 4 Turns and moves the robot to the left, No. 6 turns and moves the robot to the right, and No.5 moves the robot backward. Number 5 was chosen to move the robot backward instead of No. 8 to use fewer filters. It was observed that the 6th filter that passes the frequency 852 Hz is a redundant filter and can be omitted without any adverse effects on the circuit nor causing quality issues. Moreover, replacing No.5 with No.8 will not affect the user experience, since No.5 is very close to Number 8 and a user can adapt to such change easily.
